# DComp3
An attempt to decompile/reverse engineer Dance Central 3. 
As of writing this README, Xbox 360 tooling for a feasible decompilation is nonexistent, so this may end up being a hub of notes from reverse engineering the game rather than a proper decomp.
But you never know, this may be subject to change! So stay tuned...
